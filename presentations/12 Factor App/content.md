## Introduction
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

---

#### What is 12 Factor App?

- Methodology for building **software-as-a-service** in the **Cloud**




---

#### Why is it important? 

- **Declarative** formats for setup automation

- **Minimize divergence** between prod/dev

- **Maximum** portability between execution environments

- **Deployment** on modern cloud platforms

- Enables **continuous deployment**

- **Scale up** easily

---

#### History
 - Manifesto written around **2012**
 - by **Adam Wiggins**
   - **Heroku** (Early cloud PaaS)
    
 - Website: <a href="http://12factor.net">12factor.net</a>

---
#### For Who?
- **Any developer** building applications which run as a **service**
- Ops engineers who deploy or manage such applications

## If you use docker in production you probably **already** have a 12 factor app!

# The Factors!

---

layout: true

## The Factors

---
1. Codebase
  - One Codebase Many Deploys

2. Dependencies
  - Explicitly Declare and Isolate

3. Config
  -  Store in The Environment
  
4. Backing Services
  - As Attached Resources
  
5. Build Release Run
  - Strictly Separate Build & Run Stages
  

---

6. Processes
  - Execute The App As One or More Stateless Processes

7. Port Binding
  - Export Services Via Port Binding
  
8. Concurrency
  - Scale Out Via The Process Model

9. Disposability
  - Maximise Robustness With Fast Startup And Graceful Shutdown
  
10. Dev Prod Parity 
  - Keep Development,Staging And Production As Similar As Possible


---

11. Logs
  - Treat Logs As Event Streams
  
12. Admin Processes
  - Run Management Tasks As One-Off Processes

## 1. Codebase

One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

- Single app per codebase

---

## 2. Dependencies

Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

- Never rely on the implicit existence of any system tools
  - Example: curl

- Supports reproducible builds

- Examples of tools: pip/virtualenv, npm/yarn, ...

**HIGH IMPORTANCE!**

---

## 3. Config

Store configuration in the environment **(NOT code)**

- Config is anything that may **vary between deploys**:
  - Resource handles
  - Credentials
  - Canonical hostname for the deploy

- Strict separation of config from code

- Does not include internal application config (like Spring)


---

## 4. Backing Services

Treat backing services as attached resources

- No distinction between local and third party services

- Allows great flexibility

- Loose coupling to the attached deploy

- Resources can be attached and detached to deploys at will, no code changes

---

## 5. Build Release Run

Strictly separate build, release and run stages

- **Build** : Converts code repo into an executable bundle

- **Release** : Build with deploy's current config, ready for immediate execution

- **Run** : Launches a set of app's processes against a selected release

<img src="./images/release.png" alt="Release" style="width:60%;height:60%;" />

---
## 6. Processes

Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

- Stateless and share-nothing

- Session data should be stored with a time-expiration, e.g. Memcached or Redis

- Stateless means:
  - More robust
  - Easier to manage
  - Incurs fewer bugs
  - Scales better


---
## 7. Port binding

Export services via port binding

- Exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port

- Routing layer to handle requests routing to a hostname

- Uses Webserver libraries such as Jetty for JVM or Thin for Ruby

- One app can become the backing service for another app


---
## 8. Concurrency

Scale out via the process model

- Processes are a first class citizen

- Never daemonize or write PID files

- Relies on OS process manager (upstart, systemd, launchd, foreman, ...) to:
  - Manage output streams
  - Respond to crashed processes
  - Handle restarts and shutdowns
  

---
## 8. Concurrency

<img src="./images/process-types.png" alt="Concurrency" style="width:70%;height:70%;" />


---

## 9. Disposability

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

- Can be started or stopped at a momentâ€™s notice

- Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

- Gracefully shut down when receiving a SIGTERM signal

- Processes should be robust against sudden death

---
## 10. Dev/Prod parity

Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

- Designed for continuous deployment

- Keep the gap between development and production small:
  - Time gap: long time to prod
  - Personnel gap: developers code, ops deploy
  - Tools gap: different stack
  
- Resists to use different backing services between dev and prod


---

## 11. Logs

Treat logs as event streams

- Event stream is written to STDOUT

- Use log routers (such as Logplex and Fluent)

---
## 12. Admin Processes

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

- Run against a release: same code and config as any process run against that release

- Must ship with application code to avoid synchronization issues

- e.g. Database migration
