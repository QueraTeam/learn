## Enumerability

## Enumerability

- Our ultimate goal will be to present some celebrated theorems about **inherent limits** on
  what can be **computed** and on what can be **proved**.
- What is computability? What is provability?
  - Computations involve positive integers 1, 2, 3, ...
  - Proofs consist of sequences of symbols from the usual alphabet A, B, C, ... or some other.
- It is important to understand the relationship between **positive integers**
  and **sequences of symbols**.

## Enumerable (Countable) Set

> A set whose members can be enumerated: arranged in a single list

- Set $P$ of positive integers: $1, 2, 3, 4, ...$
- Set $N$ of natural numbers: $0, 1, 2, 3, ...$
- Set $P^{-}$ of negative integers: $-1, -2, -3, -4, ...$
- Empty set $\emptyset$ is regarded as enumerable.
- This is not acceptable: $1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...$
- Redundancy is OK: $1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...$
- Gaps are OK: $1, -, 3, -, 5, -, ...$
- Each list: function $f$ with positive integers as arguments and set members as values
  - total or partial

## Sets of Pairs

Zig-zag move in a table:

Imagine a hotel with an enumerable infinity of rooms...

$(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (1, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), (2, 3), ...$

## Diagonalization

## Diagonalization

> Not every set is enumerable!

**Cantor's Theorem:** The set of all sets of positive integers ($P^{*}$) is not enumerable.

**Proof summary:**

From any list $L$ of sets of positive integers, we discover a set $\Delta(L)$
of positive integers which is not a member of $L$.

---

## Proof of Cantor's Theorem

- We argue by *reductio ad absurdum*.

![Figure-2](images/figures/fig2.png)

$$1-s_1(1), 1-s_2(2), 1-s_3(3), 1-s_4(4), ...$$

## Imagine a Superhuman Enumerator...

- **Zeus** can enumerate any enumerable set in only 1 second!
  - How?

![Figure-3](images/figures/fig3.png)
- Zeus even can enumerate an infinite sequence of infinite lists in 1 second!
- But, Cantor proved that there are sets which even Zeus cannot enumerate.
  - No matter how fast he works, or how long. Even, infinitely long...

---

## Once We Have One, We Get Others

The set of real numbers is not enumerable.

- Consider only numbers between 0 and 1.
- And consider only numbers with 0 and 1 digits in their decimal notation.
```
0.1             1
0.01            2
0.11            1, 2
0.001           3
0.101           1, 3
...
0.010101...     2, 4, 6, ...
0.111111...     1, 2, 3, ...
```
- If this set of real numbers is enumerable, $P^*$ is enumerable too.

## Turing Computability

---

## Computation

- Zeus can write the whole table of values of a function on positive integers.
- Humans can't do this. Resources are limited.
- Fortunately, there is no need to do this.
  - We need values one at a time.
  - Given $n$, we need the value of $f(n)$.
  - We need a list of instructions to compute the value of $f(n)$.

---

## Effectively Computable Functions

> A function is **effectively computable** if there are definite, explicit rules by following which
one could in principle compute its value for any given arguments.

- In practice, a human or machine **can't** compute the value of $f(n)$ for **any** given $n$.
- In theory, it can be done in a **finite** amount of time, but...
  - This finite amount of time can be longer than your life.
  - Eventually youâ€™d be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons.
- But let's **ignore** these practical limitations
  - and work with an **idealized** notion of computability.
- In next talk, we will prove that certain functions are **not computable**,
  - even if we overcome all practical limitations.

---

## Introducing Turing-computable Functions

- Effective computability is an intuitive notion.
- We need a formalism.
- Introduce **Turing-computable** functions.

---

## Is Turing-computable == effectively computable ?

- One side is obvious from definition of Turing machine.
  - Every Turing-computable function is effectively computable.
- The converse is known as **Turing's Thesis**.
  - Not obvious
  - Can't be proved rigorously. (Because the notion of effective computability is intuitive)
  - There is an enormous amount of evidence...

---

## Numeral System in Turing Machines

- We need a **numeral system** for representing arguments and values.
- Computations can be harder with some notations (e.g. Roman numerals)
- Every numeral system can be used,
  - as long as **translation** between the systems can be carried out according to explicit rules.
- For purposes of framing a rigorously defined notion of computability,
  - it is convenient to use **monadic** or tally notation.
    
$$1, 11, 111, 1111, ...$$

---

## Turing Machine

- Computation takes place on a **tape**, unending in both directions.
- Each square is blank ($S_0$ or $0$), or has a stroke ($S_1$ or $1$).
- Has one of a finite number of **internal states**.
- Has a program. At each stage according to the current state and scanned symbol:
  - Acts on tape + Internal state changes
- Possible actions in each stage:
  - Erase, Print, Move left, Move right, Halt

## Problems

1. Consider a tape containing a block of $n$ strokes, followed by a space, followed
by a block of $m$ strokes, followed by a space, followed by a block of $k$ strokes,
and otherwise blank. Design a Turing machine that when started on the leftmost
stroke will eventually halt, having neither printed nor erased anything ...
  - (a) ... on the leftmost stroke of the second block.
  - (b) ... on the leftmost stroke of the third block.
2. Continuing the preceding problem, design a Turing machine that when started
on the leftmost stroke will eventually halt, having neither printed nor erased
anything ...
  - (a) ... on the rightmost stroke of the second block.
  - (b) ... on the rightmost stroke of the third block.
